        <p>Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy. Buried in the Biryani, you'll find whole cuts of succulent chicken bursting with flavor from the potent array of spices, herbs, and aromatics it's marinated in.</p>

      <p>In preparing for the second challenge of Project Food Blog, I came across a line in the prompt that says "We're bypassing the French and Italian standards in favor of more challenging cuisines.". The problem is, I'm Japanese, so cooking an "exotic" Asian dish felt like it was cheating. That's why I decided to make a dish that's ubiquitous and utterly simple, and yet it's something that is made wrong ninety-nine times out of a hundred. Yep, that's right, I'm making a classic pizza.</p>
